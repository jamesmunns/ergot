# Work

Okay, let's get the stream of consciousness going.

My concrete problem right now is that [I'm the only contributor](https://github.com/jamesmunns/ergot/graphs/contributors). What can I do to fix that? Let's focus on making the repo more hospitable to contributors.

How do I think I can fix that?

Let's get people understanding it, and figuring out how to contribute.

I'll start by adding more to the book.

Update: Done! See https://docs.rs/ergot/latest/ergot/book/_02_major_concepts/index.html, discuss at https://github.com/jamesmunns/ergot/discussions/67
